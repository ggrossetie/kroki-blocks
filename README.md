## Under the hood

Currently, Blocks are [React](https://reactjs.org/) components. They have a well-defined contract with their surroundings, and receive a [fixed set of props](https://github.com/githubnext/blocks/blob/main/docs/Developing%20blocks/4%20API%20reference%20and%20types.md) when they are instantiated. They are developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
